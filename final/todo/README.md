## What Does It Do?
Allows users to register and login to their own list of tasks to be completed by a specified date.
Users can create new tasks, set a due date, mark task as completed, view history of completed tasks, and change their password.

## Built With
- [Flask](https://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html) for the Python framework
- [Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/) for app logic
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) for database management
- [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/) for HTML/Python templating
- [HTML](https://devdocs.io/html/) for structuring web pages
- [CSS](https://devdocs.io/css/) for styling web pages
- [JavaScript](https://devdocs.io/javascript/) for form error checking and alert displays

## Possible Future Improvements
- Impliment sort options for tasks tables
- Impliment task priority levels and default sorting to highest priority tasks
- Fix placeholder display for "Due Date" input field on mobile devices
